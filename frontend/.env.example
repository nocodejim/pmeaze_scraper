# Frontend Environment Variables

# Base URL for the backend API
# This is used by the frontend to make requests to the backend.
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1

# Example for production if frontend and backend are served on the same domain:
# If the backend API is proxied under /api relative to the frontend's domain,
# you might use a relative path:
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=/api/v1

# Example if backend is on a completely different domain for production:
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.yourproductiondomain.com/api/v1
